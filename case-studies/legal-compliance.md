# Legal & Compliance Documentation

## Overview
EN–PT-BR localization of legal and regulatory documentation for online gambling platforms operating in regulated environments.

Content included Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policies, and compliance-related documentation requiring strict semantic accuracy and structural integrity.

---

## Project Scope
- 25,000+ words
- Terms & Conditions (T&C)
- Privacy Policies
- Regulatory and compliance documentation

---

## Key Challenges

### Legal Meaning Preservation
Ensuring semantic equivalence while maintaining enforceability and clarity in Brazilian Portuguese.

### Regulatory Exposure Mitigation
Reducing the risk of misinterpretation that could lead to compliance issues in regulated gambling environments.

### Structural & Formatting Integrity
Preserving numbering systems, clause hierarchy, cross-references, and legal formatting consistency.

---

## Localization Approach

### 1. Terminology Mapping
- Legal terminology alignment
- Cross-document consistency checks
- Controlled glossary reference

### 2. Controlled MTPE Workflow
- Structured post-editing of machine-generated content
- Error categorization and correction
- Terminology reinforcement

### 3. Linguistic Quality Assurance
- Clause-by-clause semantic validation
- Consistency verification across document sections
- Final compliance-oriented QA pass

---

## Tools Used
- MemoQ
- SDL Trados
- Translation Memory systems
- Terminology databases

---

## Outcome

Delivered publish-ready legal documentation with semantic precision, structural consistency, and terminology alignment.

Ensured regulatory-compliant localization suitable for deployment in Brazilian market environments.

| EN (Source) | PT-BR (Target) | Comments |
|-------------|----------------|----------|
| Match Result – Full Time | Resultado da Partida – Tempo regulamentar | “Tempo regulamentar” used instead of literal “tempo integral” to align with Brazilian sportsbook terminology. |
| This market applies to the result at the end of regular time (90 minutes plus injury time). Extra time and penalties do not count. | Este mercado refere-se ao resultado ao final do tempo regulamentar (90 minutos acrescidos de acréscimos). Prorrogação e disputa por pênaltis não são consideradas. | Preserved regulatory tone and clarified exclusions using common Brazilian betting phrasing. |
| Available options: Home Win / Draw / Away Win | Opções disponíveis: Vitória da equipe da casa / Empate / Vitória da equipe visitante | Adapted team references to natural Brazilian Portuguese usage. |
| If a match is abandoned before 90 minutes are completed, all bets placed on this market will be void unless the outcome has already been determined. | Caso a partida seja encerrada antes da conclusão dos 90 minutos, todas as apostas realizadas neste mercado serão anuladas, salvo se o resultado já estiver matematicamente definido. | Maintained conditional legal structure and used “serão anuladas” for regulatory clarity. |
