# Software & Technical Documentation

## Overview
EN–PT-BR localization of software documentation, platform knowledge bases, and user interface components for technology-driven platforms.

Content required high technical accuracy, structural consistency, and usability-focused language adaptation.

---

## Project Scope
- SQA documentation
- Technical knowledge bases
- UI elements and system messages
- Feature descriptions and support content

---

## Key Challenges

### Technical Terminology Accuracy
Ensuring precise adaptation of technical concepts without oversimplification or semantic distortion.

### Placeholder & Variable Integrity
Preserving system variables, placeholders, and dynamic elements without breaking functional logic.

### Formatting & Structural Consistency
Maintaining markdown, HTML, and structured document formatting where applicable.

---

## Localization Approach

### 1. Context-Aware Adaptation
- Functional understanding of feature behavior
- UI-aware localization (character limits, layout constraints)
- User-centered language adjustments

### 2. Structural Validation
- Placeholder verification
- Variable protection during localization
- Consistency checks across related UI elements

### 3. Linguistic Quality Assurance
- Terminology verification
- Functional clarity review
- Final QA pass focused on usability and readability
