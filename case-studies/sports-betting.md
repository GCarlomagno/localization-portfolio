| EN (Source) | PT-BR (Target) | Comments |
|-------------|----------------|----------|
| Match Result – Full Time | Resultado da Partida – Tempo regulamentar | “Tempo regulamentar” used instead of literal “tempo integral” to align with Brazilian sportsbook terminology. |
| This market applies to the result at the end of regular time (90 minutes plus injury time). Extra time and penalties do not count. | Este mercado refere-se ao resultado ao final do tempo regulamentar (90 minutos acrescidos de acréscimos). Prorrogação e disputa por pênaltis não são consideradas. | Preserved regulatory tone and clarified exclusions using common Brazilian betting phrasing. |
| Available options: Home Win / Draw / Away Win | Opções disponíveis: Vitória da equipe da casa / Empate / Vitória da equipe visitante | Adapted team references to natural Brazilian Portuguese usage. |
| If a match is abandoned before 90 minutes are completed, all bets placed on this market will be void unless the outcome has already been determined. | Caso a partida seja encerrada antes da conclusão dos 90 minutos, todas as apostas realizadas neste mercado serão anuladas, salvo se o resultado já estiver matematicamente definido. | Maintained conditional legal structure and used “serão anuladas” for regulatory clarity. |
